This is a script that checks your gmail account and informs you via 
SMS if you have any unread emails. This can be useful if you do not 
have good internet connectivity while on the move. email2sms is an 
open platform which can be used to send email abstracts or digests 
too. The code is limited by the coder's imagination. Feel free to 
contribute.

I took the gmail library from https://github.com/charlierguo/gmail 
and free SMS tips from http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/08/sms-using-email/.

To run type ./email2sms.py
